DSML Project 2025
This is a repository for the mobility DSML group project. Welcome everyone to our project together. On this page there will be information about our To-Dos to complete the project. All are invited to edit it.

To-Do:

Agree on a datset & Familiarize ourself with the domain and data
Define a prediction/classification problem
-> Deliver: Finished Jupyter Notebook containing information about work so far

-------- 1st Deadline 23:59h 25th May, 2025 -------------

Prepare raw data
(Potentially) Augment data with new variables/ data source
Analyse and visualise cleaned dataset
Start with predictive model
-> Deliver: 2nd finished Jupyter Notebook cointainng descriptive analyses and that we have started working on your predictive models

-------- 2nd Deadline 23:59h on 22nd of June, 2025 -------------

Develop (at least) 2 algorithms for the model
Test and evaluate the models' performance
Prepare the presentation
-> Deliver: Submit the slide deck in pdf and present in-person detailing our work

-------- 3rd Deadline 23:59h on 15th of July, 2025 -------------

Note: This is a preliminary work in progress to track our project. Steps are not necessarily sequential, some steps can be done in parallel, others might need to be re-visited.

When we develop our models, it is highly recommended to fork/branch off from the main-branch and work on it in your workspace, before getting your code reviewd by other people and merged back to the main branch. This is to avoid deleting/changing any work that might cause permanent harm later on.

Good luck & have fun :)
