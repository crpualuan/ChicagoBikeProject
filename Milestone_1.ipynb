One solution that has been suggested is to analyze the ratio of male to female bike riders and distribute the rows with missing genders accordingly. But due to the size of missing values we have decided as a group to delete them instead in order to keep the integrity of the data set as well as the correlation to other features. Despite the deletion of those rows, the data is still contains sufficient observations with over 100,000 rows. \n"

    "Features to KEEP:\n",
    "+ START TIME: Essential\n",
    "+ BIKE ID: Keep for now. While individual bike IDs might not seem predictive, they could capture effects of bike age, maintenance, or type if certain ID ranges correspond to different bike characteristics (though such details are not included in the dataset, further considerations needed)\n",
    "+ FROM STATION ID: Crucial, Trip duration is heavily dependent on its origin.\n",
    "+ USER TYPE: Important. Subscribers and casual customers often exhibit different usage patterns.\n",
    "+ GENDER: Potentially useful demographic information.\n",
    "+ BIRTH YEAR: Useful for deriving rider age.\n",
    "+ FROM LATITUDE, FROM LONGITUDE: Maybe. Since Divvy bikes can only be used to and from authorised stations, it is unclear whether specific coordinates are needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Features to REMOVE:\n",
    "+ TRIP ID: This is a unique identifier for each row and generally holds no predictive power for the duration of other trips.\n",
    "+ STOP TIME: Using this directly would be a data leak, as it inherently defines the trip duration when combined with START TIME\n",
    "+ TO STATION ID, TO LATTITUDE, TO LONGTITUDE: After further research on Divvy services, it seeems the user merely pays for the time frame and not for the distance, since the app won't ask for a destination beforehand (like Uber), therefore the destination cannot be used to predict the duration \n",
    "+ FROM STATION NAME and TO STATION NAME: These are likely redundant if FROM STATION ID and TO STATION ID are clean and used\n",
    "+ FROM LOCATION and TO LOCATION: These appear to be string representations of the latitude/longitude point data. \n",
