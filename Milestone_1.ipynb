    "A larger portion of missing values can be seen for the columns `GENDER` and `BIRTH YEAR`. Here a larger amount of rows, roughly 12,000 to 13,000 rows are missing. One solution that has been suggested is to analyze the ratio of male to female bike riders and distribute the rows with missing genders accordingly. But due to the size of missing values we have decided as a group to delete them instead in order to keep the integrity of the data set as well as the correlation to other features. Despite the deletion of those rows, the data is still contains sufficient observations with over 100,000 rows. \n"
