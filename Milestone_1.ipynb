While individual bike IDs might not seem predictive, they could capture effects of bike age, maintenance, or type if certain ID ranges correspond to different bike characteristics (though such details are not included in the dataset, further considerations needed)\n",

    "+ `TO STATION ID`, `TO LATTITUDE`, `TO LONGTITUDE`: After further research on Divvy services, it seeems the user merely pays for the time frame and not for the distance, since the app won't ask for a destination beforehand (like Uber), therefore the destination cannot be used to predict the duration \n",
    "+ `FROM STATION NAME` and `TO STATION NAME`: These are likely redundant if FROM STATION ID and TO STATION ID are clean and used\n",
